# Contributing

## How can you help our project?

Due to the fact that this is not the source code, but a repository with builds, the methods of contributing are somewhat specific.

Methods:

- Suggest a page for the site.
- Suggest a design / layout for the site.

## Check

Pages will be checked for unnecessary / harmful code and some other criteria.

If your page is approved, it will be rewritten to the site technology and added to it.

# The end.

For now, that's all I want to write here.

(Because no one but me needs this and no one but me will read it)
